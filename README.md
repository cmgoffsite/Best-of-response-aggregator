**Best Of Response Aggregator**  

Overview  
The Best Of Response Aggregator is a Streamlit-powered application
designed to streamline the process of aggregating and cleaning survey
response data. This app provides an intuitive interface for users to
upload survey data, either from a CSV file or directly via a Google
Sheets URL, and processes the data to remove duplicates, retain the most
recent responses, and ensure a complete dataset. The app is particularly
useful for analysts, researchers, and marketers who need to manage large
sets of survey data efficiently.  

**Features**

  input a Google Sheets URL to load the data directly from Google
  Sheets.

- **Advanced Data Processing**: Implements sophisticated data processing
  to aggregate responses, ensuring that the most recent and complete
  responses are retained for each unique respondent based on their email
  address.

  feedback during the data processing steps, enhancing the user
  experience by indicating the app's processing stages.

- **Downloadable Results**: Allows users to download the processed data
  in CSV or Excel formats, offering flexibility for further analysis or
  reporting.

- **User Control and Interactivity**: Includes a "Process Data" button
  that gives users control over when to initiate the data processing,
  preventing automatic processing upon file upload and ensuring
  readiness.
